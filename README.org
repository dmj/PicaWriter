#+TITLE: PicaWriter -- Classes for writing Pica+ records
#+AUTHOR: David Maus
#+EMAIL: maus@hab.de

* About

PicaWriter provides classes for writing Pica+ records to PicaXML and PicaPlain.

PicaWriter is copyright (c) 2012 by Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel and released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License v3.

* Installation

PicaWriter should be installed using the [[http://pear.php.net][PEAR Installer]]. This installer is the PHP community's
de-facto standard for installing PHP packages.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pear channel-discover hab20.hab.de/service/pear
pear install --alldeps hab20.hab.de/service/pear/PicaWriter
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage

All writers adhere to the same simple interface: You call the =Writer::write()= function with a
record instance as argument and the function returns the record encoded in the respective output
format.

* Development

If you want to patch or enhance this component, you will need to create a suitable development
environment. The easiest way to do that is to install phix4componentdev:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt-get install php5-xdebug
apt-get install php5-imagick
pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
pear -D auto_discover=1 install -Ba phix/phix4componentdev
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can then clone the Git repository:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone git://gitorious.org/php-pica/picawriter.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, install a local copy of the package's dependencies to complete the development environment:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
phing build-vender
#+END_EXAMPLE

To make life easier for you, common tasks (such as running unit tests, generating code review
analytics, and creating the PEAR package) have been automated using [[http://phing.info][Phing]]. You'll find the
automated steps inside the build.xml file that ships with the component.

Run the command 'phing' in the component's top-level folder to see the full list of available
automated tasks.

* Acknowledgements

The [[http://phix-project.org][Phix project]] makes it easy to setup and maintain a package repository for a PEAR-installable
package and integrates important tools such as [[http://phpunit.de][PHPUnit]], [[http://phing.info][Phing]], [[http://pear.php.net][PEAR]], and [[http://pirum.sensiolabs.org/][Pirum]]. Large parts of this
package would not have been possible without studying the source of [[http://search.cpan.org/dist/PICA-Record/][Pica::Record]], an open source
Perl library for handling Pica+ records by Jakob Voß, and the practical knowledge of our library's
catalogers.
